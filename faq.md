**Q: How do I develop an Auto Splitter?**  
A: The Auto Splitter Documentation is a very useful resource and guide for developing Auto Splitter components and ASL scripts. If you need further help, feel free to contact [CryZe](https://twitter.com/CryZe107) or [wooferzfg](https://twitter.com/wooferzfg) on Twitter.

**Q: Is there a way to report bugs?**  
A: If you find a bug in LiveSplit, simply contact [wooferzfg](https://twitter.com/wooferzfg) or [CryZe](https://twitter.com/CryZe107) on Twitter. You can also go to the [LiveSplit Issues](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/issues) and make a new issue.

**Q: Is LiveSplit open source?**  
A: LiveSplit is open source and can be found at the [LiveSplit GitHub](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit). We want the community to be able to extend LiveSplit and to add additional features that we might not have the time to add right away. Components are great for doing this, and they can simply work as add-ons and anyone can create them.

**Q: I want to develop a component and can’t find any documentation.**  
A: We’ll create a documentation as soon as possible.

**Q: How can I import splits from another timer like WSplit or Llanfair?**  
A: Just open them via "Open Splits From File…".

**Q: How do I remove/rename a comparison?**  
A: You can right click on the column header of the comparison in the Splits Editor and select Rename or Remove.

**Q: How do I put one of my components in a separate window?**  
A: In order to have multiple windows with different layouts, just open a second instance of LiveSplit with the same splits but with a different layout. With Global Hotkeys on, splitting on both windows will be synced. Warnings when resetting will pop up twice if they are not turned off, though.

**Q: How can I delete a best segment?**  
A: You simply select all those cells that you want to clear and then press the delete key on your Keyboard. It’ll fill them with segment information from your Personal Best.

**Q: Which URLs are supported when I open splits from URL?**  
A: Any direct URL to LiveSplit splits or splits from another timer. However, Llanfair splits don’t work yet. Also, it’ll open split links from [Speedrun.com](http://speedrun.com) or [Splits.io](http://splits.io) directly as splits as well.

**Q: How do I install the OBS plugin?**  
A: Unfortunately the OBS plugin is a bit buggy right now. So be aware of that. Usually you can just go to the settings in LiveSplit, click the install button and than after starting OBS you can simply add LiveSplit splits as a source.

**Q: The update doesn’t work inside OBS.**  
A: Don’t update LiveSplit with the OBS plugin. Open LiveSplit normally, update it and than install the OBS plugin again.

**Q: My OBS plugin doesn’t work anymore with LiveSplit 1.6. How do I update the OBS plugin?**  
A: For now, simply update LiveSplit itself and simply install the OBS plugin again.
